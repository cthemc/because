Because replaces your current comment system with a combination of polling and conversation

== Description ==

Because increases audience engagement by providing a platform for a clear and concise audience discussion relevant to their content.
Content providers created comment sections to engage audiences. However, most websites don't even get 1% of their readers to comment, and 75% of those comments are toxic or off topic! At Because, we've found a way to increase audience engagement and decrease irrelevant interactions. 
We empower the audience to give their opinion, and give content providers the discussion their content deserve!

This plugin supports the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin, so if you install that, this plugin becomes automatically updateable direct from GitHub. Any submission to WP.org repo will make this redundant.
